              After Firehand targeted the Command capital, they left us all for dead. Remaining radioactivity and dangerous infrastructure have kept them from reclaiming the former capital of the state - and from finding us.
              <br></br>
              We’ve been biding our time in a top-priority bunker, remotely coordinating a re-seizure of the government. Firehand cannot be left in power - we, the Command Ministry, pledged our lives to protecting the Command.
              <br></br>
              But tension has grown between us. Some of us have begun to doubt our purpose and believe that joining the Firehand may be the best course of action. Today, about half our members escaped the bunker in hopes of joining Firehand leadership - thereby becoming Traitors to the Command. The remaining members - the Tracers - must search for the Traitors before all hopes for the Command are erased forever.
              <br></br>
              Limited equipment means that the Tracers must search on foot, and can only risk a few minutes of exposure to the radioactive environment before they must return to the bunker. The Tracers have useful tools: with satellite imaging, they can periodically request data about distortions in the radioactivity - giving them either the distance from or direction of the Traitors. Tracers are also able to Trigger an immobilization weapon to help capture the Traitors.
              <br></br>
              The Traitors are armed with their own advantages. They can intercept all the data the Tracers receive, which lets them view the distance from or direction to the Tracers whenever the Tracers request the information. For limited amounts of time, they also have the power to disable any of the Tracers’ requests for information (Disguise), or put up a powerful reflective shield (Deflect).
              <br></br>
              If the Traitors are captured, they will face immense consequences for their treason.
              <br></br>
              If they’re not, the Tracers will have no chance to actualize their planned coup.
              <br></br>
              Either way, in mere minutes, one group will lose everything they have. So run fast. This is not a game.
